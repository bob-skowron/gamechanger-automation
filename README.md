Scripts to support automation of Game Changer schedules

## Description

Gamechanger is a popular app for managing sports teams including scheduling, scoring, communication, and stats gathering. However, it doesn't support an API or upload process for multiple events. This project uses Selenium to log into the account and use a CSV as input to generate events.
